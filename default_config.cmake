# Default configuration options for OSAL
#
# This file specifies the default values for various compile-time options
# supported by OSAL.  These options can be further tuned by the specific
# OSAL and BSP selection, as well as the user application.
#
# NOTE:
# The defaults in this file should _not_ be directly modified for tuning.
#
# Instead, use the "OSAL_CONFIGURATION_FILE" CMake variable to define
# a custom file which can override/modify the configuration for the items
# which require tuning.

# Code/Feature Selection Options for the OSAL implementation
##############################################################


# OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_NETWORK
# ----------------------------------
#
# Whether to include the Network API
#
# If set TRUE, the the socket abstraction (if applicable on the platform)
# will be included.  If set FALSE, then all calls to the network API will
# return OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
#
# This can be set FALSE for platforms which do not have a network or
# IP stack available, or to save code space if the application does
# not use network resources.
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_NETWORK                 TRUE)


#
# OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_LOADER
# ----------------------------------
#
# Whether to include the capability of loading dynamic code objects
#
# This is normally set TRUE to support modularized applications on
# platforms which have this capability.
#
# For deployments which are always statically linked, this may be set
# FALSE for a smaller library size and reduced linking requirements.
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_LOADER          TRUE)


#
# OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_STATIC_LOADER
# ----------------------------------
#
# Whether to include a compatibility "loader" for statically-linked objects
#
# This feature allows applications normally written for dynamic module loading
# operate transparently in a static link environment.  If this is set TRUE,
# then the application must supply an object named "OS_STATIC_SYMBOL_TABLE" that
# contains the names and addresses of statically-linked symbols that should
# be known to the lookup/load functions.
#
# Note that modules "loaded" using this abstraction are still assigned a
# module ID and still require a slot in the module table even though
# no actual runtime loading is performed (see OSAL_CONFIG_MAX_MODULES).
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_STATIC_LOADER           TRUE)

#
# OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_SHELL
# ----------------------------------
#
# Whether to include features which utilize the operating system shell.
#
# Remote Shell commands can be very powerful tool for remotely diagnosing
# and mitigating runtime issues in the field, but also have significant
# security implications.  If this is set to "false" then shell functionality
# is disabled and OSAL functions which invoke the shell will return
# OS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_INCLUDE_SHELL                   FALSE)


#
# OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE
# ----------------------------------
#
# The OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE option controls how privileged operations
# are handled by the OSAL in the event that the user does not have sufficient permission.
# In particular this applies to task priorities and message queues.
#
# If set FALSE, then all permissions are enforced, and a failure due to lack of permission
# will cause a failure of the overall operation, which is passed back to the application.
#
# If set to TRUE, this will treat some errors non-fatal and enable a graceful fallback,
# allowing the overall operation to complete in a reduced form.  This makes the
# OSAL library compatible with a non-root (normal user mode) environment.
#
# In the PC-Linux/Posix build, this means:
#  - A message queue deeper than the maximum system limit will be silently truncated
#    to the maximum system limit (no error).
#  - If the user does not have permission to create elevated priority tasks, then the tasks will
#    be created at the default priority (no error).
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PERMISSIVE_MODE           FALSE)

#
# OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PRINTF
# ----------------------------------
#
# Controls inclusion of OS_DEBUG statements in the code
#
# If set FALSE, all OS_DEBUG statements are compiled out.
#
# If set TRUE, all the "OS_DEBUG" statements will be compiled in and displayed
# on the debug console.  The statements may still be suppressed at runtime.
#
set(OSAL_CONFIG_DEBUG_PRINTF                    FALSE)
