# OSAL SHARED LAYER FOR COVERAGE TESTING
# --------------------------------------

# This CMake recipe snippet builds the _actual_ OSAL implementation (not a stub)
# However it differs from the regular non-UT build in the following ways:
# - Each sub-module is compiled to a separate "OBJECT" library
#       this simplifies the testrunner linking by allow only one specific
#       object file to be linked into each test
# - Each sub-module is wrapped to divert C library calls to the
#       stub (OCS) counterpart
# - UT_COVERAGE_COMPILE_FLAGS are enabled to include any code coverage instrumentation

# the "overrides" dir contains empty versions of the C-library include files.
