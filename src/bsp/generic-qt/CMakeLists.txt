# This basic implementation library should be generic enough to use
# on any Linux-based processor board, as well as a standard development PC.

# OSAL needs conformance to at least POSIX.1c (aka POSIX 1995) - this includes all the
# real-time support and threading extensions.
#
# When compiling against glibc, using "_XOPEN_SOURCE=600" enables the X/Open 6 standard.
# XPG6 includes all necessary XPG5, POSIX.1c features as well as SUSv2/UNIX98 extensions.
# This OSAL implementation uses clock_nanosleep(), mq_timedreceive(), and
# mq_timedsend() which are enhancements added in the XPG6 standard.
#
# See http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Feature-Test-Macros.html
# for a more detailed description of the feature test macros and available values

# This BSP only works with "posix" OS layer.
