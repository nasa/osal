   Function: OS_SelectSingle_Impl

   Purpose: Waits for activity on a single file descriptor
            This wrapper is usable by the File or Socket API
            The type of activity to wait for is indicated by "SelectFlags"
            msecs indicates the timeout.  Positive values will wait up to that many milliseconds.
            Zero will not wait (poll) or negative values will wait forever (pend)

            Bits in "SelectFlags" will be unset according to activity

    Returns: OS_SUCCESS on success, or relevant error code
             OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the specified file handle does not support select

   Function: OS_SelectMultiple_Impl

   Purpose: Waits for activity on multiple file descriptors
            This wrapper is usable by the File or Socket API
            Will wait for any file descriptor in "ReadSet" to be readable OR
            any descriptor in "WriteSet" to be writable.
            Time-Limited to "msecs" (negative to wait forever, zero to poll)

   Notes: It is not possible for this function to verify that the file descriptors
          passed in are actually valid.  In order to do so would require a different
          approach to the OS_FdSet structure (this is currently just a bitmask so
          the actual file descriptor value is lost in translation).

          Using an array of uint32's would solve the problem but make the structures
          much bigger.

          File descriptors in sets be modified according to activity

    Returns: OS_SUCCESS on success, or relevant error code
             OS_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the specified file handle(s) do not support select
