/**
 * @brief Creates a condition variable resource
 *
 * A condition variable adds a more sophisticated synchronization option for mutexes,
 * such that it can operate on arbitrary user-defined conditions rather than simply a
 * counter or boolean (as in the case of simple semaphores).
 *
 * Creating a condition variable resource in OSAL will in turn create both a basic mutex
 * as well as a synchronization overlay.  The underlying mutex is similar to the mutex
 * functionality provided by the OSAL mutex subsystem, and can be locked and unlocked
 * normally.
 *
 * This mutex is intended to protect access to any arbitrary user-defined data object that
 * serves as the condition being tested.
 *
 * A task that needs a particular state of the object should follow this general flow:
 *  - Lock the underlying mutex
 *  - Test for the condition being waited for (a user-defined check on user-defined data)
 *  - If condition IS NOT met, then call OS_CondVarWait() to wait, then repeat test
 *  - If condition IS met, then unlock the underlying mutex and continue
 *
 * A task that changes the state of the object should follow this general flow:
 *  - Lock the underlying mutex
 *  - Change the state as necessary
 *  - Call either OS_CondVarSignal() or OS_CondVarBroadcast()
 *  - Unlock the underlying mutex
 *
 * @param[out]  var_id will be set to the non-zero ID of the newly-created resource @nonnull
 * @param[in]   var_name the name of the new resource to create @nonnull
 * @param[in]   options reserved for future use.  Should be passed as 0.
 *
 * @return Execution status, see @ref OSReturnCodes
 * @retval #OS_SUCCESS @copybrief OS_SUCCESS
 * @retval #OS_INVALID_POINTER if var_id or var_name are NULL
 * @retval #OS_ERR_NAME_TOO_LONG name length including null terminator greater than #OS_MAX_API_NAME
 * @retval #OS_ERR_NO_FREE_IDS if there are no more free condition variable Ids

 * that there is no possibility that another task could acquire the mutex before the
 * calling task has actually blocked.
 *
 * This atomicity with respect to blocking the task and unlocking the mutex is a
 * critical difference between condition variables and other synchronization
 * primitives.  It avoids a window of opportunity where inherent in the simpler
