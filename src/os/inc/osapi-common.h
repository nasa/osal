 * @note This is a "best-effort" routine and it may not always be possible/guaranteed
 * to recover all resources, particularly in the case of off-nominal conditions, or if
 * a resource is used outside of OSAL.
 *
 * For example, while this will attempt to unload all dynamically-loaded modules, doing
