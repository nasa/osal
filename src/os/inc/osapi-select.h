 * As this operates on a single ID, the filehandle is protected
 * during this call, such that another thread accessing the same
 * handle will return an error.  However, it is important to note that
 * once the call returns then other threads may then also read/write
 * and affect the state before the current thread can service it.
 *
 * To mitigate this risk the application may prefer to use
 * the OS_TimedRead/OS_TimedWrite calls.
