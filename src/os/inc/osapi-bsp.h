   Function: OS_BSP_GetArgC

    Purpose: Obtain the number of boot arguments passed from the bootloader
             or shell if supported by the platform

    Returns: The number of boot arguments, or 0 if no arguments were passed
             or not supported by the BSP.

/*----------------------------------------------------------------
   Function: OS_BSP_GetArgV

    Purpose: Obtain an array of boot argument strings passed from the bootloader
             or shell if supported by the platform

    Returns: Pointer to char* array containing the argument strings, or NULL if
             no arguments are available or not supported by the BSP.

             The array is sized according to OS_BSP_GetArgC()

/*----------------------------------------------------------------
   Function: OS_BSP_SetExitCode

    Purpose: Sets the status to be returned to the shell or bootloader
             if supported by the platform.  The value is an integer with
             platform and application-defined meaning, but BSP's should
             attempt to provide consistent meaning for the following values

             OS_SUCCESS: normal status (default)
             OS_ERROR: any abnormal status

             Other more specific status values may be passed, with
             implementation-defined behavior.  Depending on the system
             capabilities, the BSP implementation may either pass the
             value through as-is, translate it to defined value, or
             ignore it.

             Note this does NOT cause the application to exit, it only
             sets the state that will be returned if/when the application
             exits itself at a future time.
